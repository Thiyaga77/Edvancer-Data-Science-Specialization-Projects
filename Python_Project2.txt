To Mail or Not to Mail

Direct mailings to a company’s potential customers – “junk mail” to many – can be a very effective way for them
to market a product or a service. However, as we all know, much of this junk mail is really of no interest to the
people that receive it. Most of it ends up thrown away, not only wasting the money that the company spent on it,
but also filling up landfill waste sites or needing to be recycled.

If the company had a better understanding of who their potential customers were, they would know more
accurately who to send it to, so some of this waste and expense could be reduced.

Formal Problem Statement

We want you to predict whether a customer is interested in a caravan insurance policy from other data about the
customer. Information about customers consists of 86 variables and includes product usage data and sociodemographic data derived from zip area codes. The data was supplied based on a real world business problem.
The training set contains over 5000 descriptions of customers, including the information of whether or not they
have a caravan insurance policy. A test set contains 4000 customers of whom target variable is not shared with
you.
Target Variable is V86.
You need to use train data for building the model and then use that model to predict outcome for given test data.
Test dataset does not have a response column; you need to predict those values and submit it in a csv format.
We expect outcomes to be either 0 or 1.

Part 2:

Here you work on creating the machine learning models and choosing the one which gives the best
performance. You can refer to the Project Process Guides provided in LMS to understand how to approach and
work on a project.
In order to get a passing grade in this project you need to get Fbeta score greater than 0.26 [ beta =2 ] for your
test data predictions.
